Web Portfolio for Coderhouse's Course Web Development

I took a web development course on Coderhuse, and after almost three months of this course this is the result. In this repository you can find all my code, the principal tools that I used for my final project were: HTML 5 for the structure and navigation, Bootstrap for some things like navbar, tabs gallery, modal etc. 

Despite of all Bootstrap CSS Library I coded native CSS to define my own styles on my website, also I used Sass with its principal functions like mixins, variables, map’s etc.

Talking about the responsive part I used Bootstrap and media queries on css, so, if you visit my website you’ll haven’t any problems in any device.

The last technical thing that I have to say it’s about the SEO, I used basic technics like meta tags (title and description) on each page, also I tried to optimize the size of each image and in the code I added an alt description and an strategy called loading lazy.

About the conceptual part I made this project like a resume and portfolio, and I think that my principal goal it’s to show my bests works and projects of design, painting and of course web design.

So, this is my project, and I need to give the thanks to Coderhouse’s team, they are an incredible persons and the way that they have for teaching it’s amazing.
